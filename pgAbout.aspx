    <h3>Our History</h3>
    <p>
        Williams Specialty Company started in 1968 through a random moment of both chance and luck. 
        Dean Williams, a jewelry engraver at the time, and his brother Randy had always had the 
        desire to go into business together. One day a gentleman in somewhat of a bind brought 
        several trophies to Paul to be engraved. At that moment the brothers realized that this was 
        the business opportunity they had been waiting for and they started Williams Brothers Inc. 
        "The Trophy People" in the fall of 1968 in Urbana, Illinois. After many months of hard work 
        and anticipation, the first trophy was sold in February of 1969; and so prompted the growth 
        of one of the largest and most reputable trophy and awards companies in America.
